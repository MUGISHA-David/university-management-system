# University Management System

## Project Overview
The **University Management System** is a software application designed to manage and automate
core university operations. The system handles user input, validates data, processes requests,
interacts with a database, and returns accurate results while following best programming
practices and software design principles.

This project demonstrates a real-life university system where a user submits data, the system
validates and processes it, interacts with a database, and returns results. The system models
typical university workflows such as data entry, validation, storage, and retrieval.

## System Diagrams

### 1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
The Data Flow Diagram illustrates how data moves through the University Management System.

**Description:**
- The user sends input to the system
- The system processes the request
- Data is stored or retrieved from the database
- The system sends output back to the user

### 2. Activity Diagram
The Activity Diagram shows the sequence of activities and decision points in the system.

**Description:**
- User submits input
- System validates the input
- If valid, the system processes and stores data
- If invalid, an error message is displayed
- The result is returned to the user
